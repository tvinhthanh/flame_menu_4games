=== SPINE ANIMATION VALIDATION REPORT ===

Generated: 2026-01-04 00:48:45.808079

=== EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ===
Total animations: 4
✅ Safe animations: 3
❌ Unsafe animations: 1
Critical errors: 2
Warnings (non-critical): 0

=== CRITICAL ISSUES (REQUIRE FIX) ===

--- Animation: "death" ---
  ❌ [Instance of 'AnimationIssue'.type] Bone "eye-veins-controller": Missing keyframe at animation end (last time=1.0, duration=2.1333)
  ❌ [Instance of 'AnimationIssue'.type] DrawOrder: Last frame draw order != first frame - will cause state pollution

💡 RECOMMENDATION: Fix these issues in Spine Editor to prevent state pollution.

=== ANIMATION SAFETY STATUS ===

✅ Safe to switch (3):
  - hit
  - jump
  - run

❌ Requires reset when switching (1):
  - death

=== NOTES ===
• "Frame 0 != setup pose" warnings are NORMAL in Spine and do not need fixing.
• Only ERRORS (missing keyframes, non-matching last frame) require attention.
• Runtime currently resets skeleton when switching animations (defensive handling).
• Fixing critical issues will allow smoother animation transitions in the future.
